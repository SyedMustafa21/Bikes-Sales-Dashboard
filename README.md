## ðŸ§  Project: Bike Sales Performance Dashboard

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This project showcases an interactive **Bike Sales Performance Dashboard** developed using **Microsoft Excel**. The dashboard provides a dynamic, single-screen view of crucial customer demographic data and their correlation with bike purchasing behavior. By visualizing key metrics such as Average Income, Age Brackets, and Commute Distance, this tool is designed to help business stakeholders identify high-value customer segments, optimize marketing strategies, and improve inventory planning. The project emphasizes the effective use of native Excel features like Pivot Tables and Slicers to create a professional and highly functional Business Intelligence (BI) report.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

* **Interactive Slicers:** Allows instant data filtering based on **Marital Status, Region,** and **Education Level**, providing granular analysis capabilities.
* **Income Analysis by Gender:** A stacked bar chart visualizing the **Average Income per Purchase** split by gender and whether a bike was purchased.
* **Customer Age Profile:** A line chart illustrating the **Count of Purchased Bikes** across different **Age Brackets** (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old).
* **Commute Behavior Analysis:** A line chart detailing the relationship between **Commute Distance** and the **Count of Purchased Bikes**.
* **Dynamic Data Aggregation:** All charts and metrics update instantly upon filtering using the interactive slicers and pivot table filters.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

The following insights are directly derived from the visual trends presented in the dashboard's charts (before applying any slicer filters):

### 1. Income & Purchasing Power

* **High Income Propensity:** Across both genders, customers who **purchased a bike (Yes)** have a significantly **higher average income** than those who did not. This reinforces the need to target higher-income customer segments.
* **Gender Income Lead:** On average, **Female** customers who bought a bike have the highest income bracket visible on the chart, slightly exceeding that of Male customers who bought a bike.

### 2. Age and Sales Volume

* **Peak Customer Segment:** The **Middle Age** bracket is the most crucial segment, responsible for the highest volume of bike purchases (approximately 140 'Yes' purchases).
* **Lowest Engagement:** The **Old** age bracket shows the lowest count of purchases, indicating a lower priority segment for general sales efforts.
* **High Volume in 'No' Purchases:** Interestingly, the **Middle Age** group also has the highest number of non-purchasers (nearly 200 'No' purchases), suggesting this group represents the largest potential for conversion if barriers (e.g., price, specific product need) are addressed.

### 3. Commute Behavior

* **Commute Correlates with Purchase:** The majority of customers who purchased a bike fall into the **0-1 Miles** commute distance bracket. This suggests the product is primarily driven by short-distance commuter or recreational needs.
* **Drop-off at 1-2 Miles:** There is a sharp decrease in bo<img 
th 'Yes' and 'No' purchases once the commute distance exceeds 1 mile, emphasizing the local market focus.
* **Non-Purchaser Behavior:** Non-purchasers ('No') peak in the **0-1 Miles** range, but the drop-off after 1-2 miles is less steep than for purchasers, indicating that while they live close, they choose other means for slightly longer commutes.
